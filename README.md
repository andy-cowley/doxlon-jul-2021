# What is this?

This is a presentation to be given at DevOps Exchange London on the 29th July 2021. It's made
using [`present`](https://github.com/vinayak-mehta/present) a terminal based presentation tool
because other slides tools make me :sad:

If you want to view the presentation locally:

```shell
$ pip install present

$ present lessons-learnt-while-teaching-an-adas-company-to-devops.md
```

Speaker notes are in the cryptically titled `notes.md`
